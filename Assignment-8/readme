Assignment 8 - Description. Grade 10/10.

Implement a FIFO queue up to some bounded maximum size to hold String objects that can be accessed by multiple 
Producer and Consumer threads. The Producer threads produce String objects while the Consumer threads consume these objects. 
Every String object produced must be consumed exactly once.  Use the ReentrantLock class and Condition variables in your 
implementation.

Write an application class that create a random number of Producer and Consumer threads at startup to test your implementation.

Print out queue statistics e.g. number of items in the queue and thread access details as the simulation progresses. 

Keep your code simple and elegant. Use comments to explain your code (1 mark).

Submit your code in the format assignment9_fname_lname.zip. Also include your details (name, id etc) in the java files. (1 mark)

 Show the queue statistics using snapshots in a pdf/doc file ( 1 mark)
