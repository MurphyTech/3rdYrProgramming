Assignment 4 - Description. Grade 9/10.

Write a Java class called Rational for performing arithmetic with rational numbers. 
(A rational no. is a number that can be expressed in the form of p/q, where p,q are integers 
with q !=0 and p and q have no common divisor) .Make the class implement the comparable 
interface so that each object should be able to compare itself to another object of the same type(4 marks) .

Write a Java program that uses an ArrayList to store a collection of 10 Rational objects. 
Write a simple algorithm that manually iterates through the contents of the list and places them 
in ascending (i.e. smallest Rational to the biggest Rational) order into a new list. 
You should use insertion sort to do the sorting â€“ do NOT use the built-in sort algorithm at this stage (4 marks).

Print out the contents of the list after sorting the contents to verify the results (1 mark).

Keep your program simple and elegant and use commenting wherever necessary. (1 mark).
